# Y-Combinator-Impl
![y.combinator](img/y-combinator.png)

This is my implementations of the Y-Combinator in different programming languages. The Y-Combinator is a way to make recursive functions in programming languages which does not support it. It was discovered by [Haskell B. Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry) and defined using [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).


## Inspiration
I learned about the Y-combinator when watching the ComputerPhiles video about the Y-Combinator after watching their video about lambda calculus. I did not quite understand it at first. Therfore I decided to try and implement it to get a better understand it
