# Y-Combinator-Impl
![y.combinator](./y-combinator.png)

My implementations of the Y-Combinator in diffent programming languages. The Y-Combinator is a way to make recursive function in programming languages which does not support it. It was discovered by [Haskell B. Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry) and defined using [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).


## Inspiration
I learned about the Y-combinator when watching the ComputerPhiles video about the Y-Combinator after watching their video about lambda calculus. I did not quite understand it and decided to try and implement it in `Javascript`, which was a big challenge at first. But then I researched a little online and got a better understanding.
